## 1. Project Overview
This project analyzes customer behavior and marketing campaign effectiveness using **SQL** for data extraction, cleaning, and analysis. The final strategic insights are visualized using **Excel**.

---

## 2. Key Business Questions Addressed
This analysis was designed to answer critical strategic questions about customer behavior and marketing effectiveness:

* Which channel represents the majority of purchases: web, catalog, or store?
* How can we classify customers into high, medium, or low spenders based on total purchases?
* Which marketing campaign had the highest acceptance rate?
* How does having children impact spending on specific product categories?
* What is the relationship between customer recency (days since last purchase) and total spending?
* Do more web visits per month correlate with higher spending?
